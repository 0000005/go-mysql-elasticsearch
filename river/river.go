package river

// In Elasticsearch, river is a pluggable service within Elasticsearch pulling data then indexing it into Elasticsearch.
// We use this definition here too, although it may not run within Elasticsearch.
// Maybe later I can implement a acutal river in Elasticsearch, but I must learn java. :-)
